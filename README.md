# Version Control with Git and GitHub

#### This repo contains the training materials used in the second session of the HHR Data Science Interest Group, titled “Version Control with Git and GitHub.” The session introduces the fundamental concepts of version control, why it matters, and how to apply it in research and collaborative data science projects.
#### Key topics covered include:
* Understanding version control and its importance (tracking changes, collaboration, documentation, and knowledge retention).
* Overview of Git as a version control software and GitHub as a collaboration cloud platform.
* Creating and managing repositories (local and remote).
* Best practices in version control (commits, README files, .gitignore, and commit messages).
* Collaboration workflows: cloning vs forking, pull requests, and branching.
* Hands-on practicum exercises, including creating repositories, pushing changes, and collaborating via forks and pull requests.

This repository serves as both a reference and a practical resource for participants to strengthen their skills in Git and GitHub, enabling better collaboration and reproducibility in reseach and data science projects.
